The Manifest V2 deprecation is on hold, at least until we deliver on the items below. We want to provide you with solutions to migration challenges with new features, bug fixes, and adequatre time for adoption. Chec this page periodically for improvements to Manifest V3.

For information on the timeline, [read the update](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-extensions/c/zQ77HkGmK9E) in the chromium-extensions Google Group.

## Planned enhancements {: #planned-enhancements }

The following enhancement is currently under development.

### Userscript managers support {: #userscript-managers-support }

Userscript managers cannot inject scripts that are not included in the extension's package because of platform and policy changes that prevent arbitrary code execution. To address this, Manifest V3 is being expanded to specifically support user-authored scripts and styles.

**Estimated timeline:** Targeting Canary support in the second quarter of 2023.
