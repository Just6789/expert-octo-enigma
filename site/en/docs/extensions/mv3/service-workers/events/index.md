Extension service workers support both the [standard service worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope#events) events and many events available through the [extension APIs](/docs/extensions/reference/). This section describes what's available and provides tips for using them.

## Service worker events

Extension service workers support more than the lifecycle events [described elsewhere](link The service worker lifecycle). Some of those events require additional.

### ServiceWorkerGlobal.fetch

Fired when anything is retrieved from the extension package or when `fetch()` and `XMLHttpRequest()` are called from an extension script. In the latter cases, you will need to add the URLs of the pages you want to fetch to the `"host_permissions"` key in the `manifest.json`.

### ServiceWorkerGlobal.message

Extensions support their own [messaging passing](/docs/extensions/mv3/messaging/) capabilities. Service worker message passing is also available, but the two systems are not interoperable. If you need or want to use service worker message passing, you would do so using the service worker registration. For example, you could implement the following code in a popup script.

```javascript
postMsgButton.addEventListener('click', async () => {
  navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((registration) => {
    const msg = { greeting: "Hello, service worker." }
    registration.active.postMessage(msg);
  });
});
```

## Declaring extension events

Event handlers in service workers need to be declared in the global scope, meaning they should be at the top level of the script and not be nested inside functions. This ensures that they are registered synchronously on initial script execution, which enables Chrome to events to the service worker as soon as it starts. For example:

{% Compare 'worse', 'Not advised' %}
```js/2
chrome.storage.local.get(["badgeText"], ({ badgeText }) => {
  chrome.browserAction.setBadgeText({ text: badgeText });
  chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(handleActionClick);
});

```
{% endCompare %}


{% Compare 'better', 'Better' %}
```js/0
chrome.action.onClicked.addListener(handleActionClick);

chrome.storage.local.get(["badgeText"], ({ badgeText }) => {
  chrome.action.setBadgeText({ text: badgeText });
});
```
{% endCompare %}

## Available events

Extension service workers support events in specific APIs as described below. Note that some of these APIs require permissions to use and others are not available in all versions of Chrome. See the linked API documentation for details.

[`chrome.action`](/docs/extensions/reference/action/)
: Fired in response to a user interaction with your extension's toolbar icon, whether that action be for a specific page (tab) or for the whole extension.

[`chrome.management`](/docs/extensions/reference/management/)
: Provides events related to the installation, uninstallation, enabling, and disabling extensions.

[`chrome.notifications`](/docs/extensions/reference/notifications/)
: Provides events related to the user's interaction with system notifications generated by the extension.

[`chrome.permissions`](/docs/extensions/reference/permissions/)
: Indicates when extension permissions are granted or revoked by the user.

[`chrome.runtime`](/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/)
: Provides events related to the extension lifecycle, messages sent from other parts of the extension, and notification of an available extension or Chrome update. 

[`chrome.storage.onChanged`](/docs/extensions/reference/storage/#event-onChanged)
: Fired whenever any [`StorageArea`](/docs/extensions/reference/storage/#type-StorageArea) object is cleared or when the value of a key is changed or set. Note that the each `StorageArea` instance has its own [`onChanged`](/docs/extensions/reference/storage/#type-StorageArea:~:text=PROPERTIES-,onChanged,-event) event. 

[`chrome.webNavigation`](/docs/extensions/reference/webNavigation/)
: Provides information about the status of in-flight navigation requests.

## Filters

To restrict users to specific use case, or eliminate unnecessary event calls, use APIs that support [event filters](/docs/extensions/reference/events#filtered). For example, consider an extension listening for the [`tabs.onUpdated`](/docs/extensions/reference/extensions/tabs#event-onUpdated) event to detect when a user navigates to a specific website. This event will be called on every navigation on every tab. Instead, use [`webNavigation.onCompleted`](/docs/extensions/reference/webNavigation/#event-onCompleted) with a filter. For example:

```js
const filter = {
  url: [
    {
      urlMatches: 'https://www.google.com/',
    },
  ],
};

chrome.webNavigation.onCompleted.addListener(() => {
  console.info("The user has loaded my favorite website!");
}, filter);
```
